How it works:

Sample:


- Enter the student or participant‚Äôs ID and name.



![pic2](https://github.com/JohnMartin0301/Automated-Attendance-System-using-QR-Code/assets/112761826/384b6feb-8010-46d7-a199-b6775af10d62)



- Click generate Qr code containing the attendance information then save the Qr code in a directory. You can take a picture or print it on an ID card or display it digitally for future use. (For this time we will save it on a directory then take a picture of the Qr code).



![pic3](https://github.com/JohnMartin0301/Automated-Attendance-System-using-QR-Code/assets/112761826/c1c9749b-dc3f-4e90-9781-46da5c0d4e3e)



- To record attendance, simply use a camera or QR code scanner to capture the QR code. The system will decode the QR code, extract the attendance information, and mark the individual as present. The attendance record is then displayed to the user, providing immediate feedback.

## *SecURL





A simple GUI app built using Python that checks if a URL/Link is safe or not. This can help prevent Phishing Attacks which is very common nowadays.





SecURL is a simple Python application that allows you to check the safety of a URL. It helps you determine whether a given URL is safe or potentially harmful by making HTTP requests and analyzing the response status.





![SecURL01](https://github.com/JohnMartin0301/SecURL/assets/112761826/e1746a33-04a8-47aa-9662-81751f8a5511)






SecURL offers the following:

- Accepts user input for a URL/Link to be checked.

- Verifies the safety of the URL/Link by sending a GET request and checking the response status.

- Notifies the user whether the URL/Link is safe or not.





Sample:



![SecURL02](https://github.com/JohnMartin0301/SecURL/assets/112761826/b9d808be-4968-4649-878f-9d56404890dd)



![SecURL03](https://github.com/JohnMartin0301/SecURL/assets/112761826/7b8d47a0-08bf-48fe-a6a9-1a578c2f11af)





SecURL provides a straightforward way to assess the safety of a URL. It sends a GET request to the specified URL and examines the response status code. If the response status code indicates success (less than 400), the URL is considered safe; otherwise, it is flagged as potentially unsafe. This tool is useful for quickly checking the safety of URLs you encounter.





## Usage

To use SecURL, follow these simple steps:

1. **Run the Program:**
   - Run the `main.py` file using Python.
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Enter URL:**
   - Enter the URL you want to check in the provided entry field.

3. **Check URL Safety:**
   - Click the "Check URL Safety" button.
   - The program will send an HTTP request to the URL and display whether it's safe or not.

4. **View Result:**
   - The result label will update with the safety status.
   - A safe URL is indicated in green text, while an unsafe URL is indicated in red text.





Technical Overview:

1. tkinter (import tkinter as tk):
- tkinter is a standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- It provides a set of tools and widgets to build windows, buttons, labels, entry fields, and more.
- In the URL Safety Checker program, tkinter is used to create the GUI elements, such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and the main application window.



2. urllib3 (import urllib3):
- urllib3 is a powerful, user-friendly HTTP client library for Python.
- It provides a higher-level abstraction over the standard urllib library for making HTTP requests.
- In the URL Safety Checker program, urllib3 is used to send HTTP GET requests to check the safety of the provided URL.
- It also handles the response and analyzes the response status to determine the safety of the URL.



3. urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError:
- This is an exception class provided by the urllib3 library.
- It is used to handle exceptions that occur when the maximum number of retries is exceeded for an HTTP request.
- In the URL Safety Checker program, this exception is caught to handle potential errors when making HTTP requests.



These modules/libraries provide the necessary functionality for creating the GUI, making HTTP requests, and handling exceptions in the URL Safety Checker program. They enable the program to interact with the user, retrieve the URL for checking, send HTTP requests to validate the safety, and display the result in the GUI.





Check the safety of URLs quickly and easily with SecURL. Whether you're verifying links or ensuring online safety, this tool provides immediate feedback on URL safety. Stay safe online! üîê
